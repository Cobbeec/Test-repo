# Test-repo

A short description
This is a CLI project that uses the Meal DB https://www.themealdb.com/api.php for a recipe app. The app allows a user to search for recipes by using categories and ingredients. 

Install instructions
This is all saved under TEST-REPO and contains five ruby files: ingredient, meal, api, category, and cli. The files are integrated through the environment. This project also uses net:http and JSON. You should use the CLI.rb file to interact with the program.
